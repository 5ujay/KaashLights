Light for factories and warehouses should support the safety and production with good quality illuminance but also enhance the well-being of workers by creating a vibrant work environment.",

Integrated light solutions give real-time feedback about space use and light performance for cost-effective decisions. Good lighting creates productive and positive atmosphere to keep people focussed and aware."
